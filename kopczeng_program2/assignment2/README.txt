This program can be compiled on the os1 server by typing the following:
gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies main.c movie.c list.c

To then run the program, type the following:
./movies

Other notes:
I have several different .csv files included, I used these to test. They are all part of the same file, 
just some files have less or different movies that others
